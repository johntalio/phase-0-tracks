# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a repository of files, where people can create or make changes to existing code. Version control is useful because it allows coders to distribute and collaborate on their code easily. It also allows coders to keep track of any changes made to any existing code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a code file separate from the source code file, or the "master" in Git. Branches allow for the modification of a source code file without making direct changes to the source code file itself.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit records any changes made to a git repository. A good commit message conveys what changes were made to the repository in the previous commit and possibly what still needs to be accomplished.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two distinct changes are made to the same file and both are committed - Git will not know which change is the "correct" change, and so will flag both as conflicting.
