<h3>My Comments for GPS 1.2</h3>
	<p>The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to provide the meaning of the content contained within the tags to the user, and to clearly describe its meaning to the browser as well. I find paragraph tags most useful because they are the easiest and most direct way a user can communicate through their website.</p>
	<p>On any given HTML page, the browser will load the html tag first, as this informs the browser as to how to format the webpage. After that, though, HTML pages are interpreted entirely from top to bottom - the first elements will load first, the last elements will load last.</p>
	<p>In this challenge I learned how to create a Sublime snippet and where snippets are saved. I also learned that saving snippets to the correct location on your computer is important, because, otherwise, Sublime will not be able to pull the snippet for use. I may create a Sublime snippet in the future if I find myself using a particular element frequently, or if I need to set up multiple Sublime files according to a specific format.</p>
	<p>The most difficult part of this challenge for me was formatting the Sublime snippet properly, and then saving that snippet to the proper location on my computer. This was something that was new to me, so it required some research and trial and error to get right. I think that I can improve my knowledge and mastery of snippets by creating new ones for future use and doing some more research on them. I may also turn to office hours if I get stuck.</p>
