Getting Started with jQuery:

* Research online tutorials, cheat sheets, and other introductory material for jQuery.

	* Read over whatever material I can find about jQuery: what it is, how to use it, syntax, methods, etc.

	* Check out W3schools's tutorial on jQuery.

* Test frequently; after adding a line or a few lines of code, make sure to run it.

	* Online resources like jsfiddle are also available for testing purposes.

* Save/bookmark valuable resources for future reference.
