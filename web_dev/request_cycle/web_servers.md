* What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

As paraphrased from Mike Gancarz, the author of Linux and the Unix Philosophy, the design philosophy of Linux is primarily concerned with competency and freedom. The so-called "radical concept" that gave birth to Unix dictates that the user of the OS is computer literate from the beginning and that the user knows exactly what they are doing. Additionally, Unix was not designed to prevent its users from doing stupid things, because that would also prevent them from doing important things.

* In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A virtual private server, or VPS, is a virtual machine that functions as its own copy of an operating system; a VPS is functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server, but is more easily created and configured. The advantages of using a VPS as opposed to a physical dedicated server is that, as I mentioned, it is more easily created and configured, it is cheaper than its physical counterpart, it can be customized to meet a specific user's needs, and a user can have more control over their own personal VPS.

* Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Root is a superuser, meaning it can do anything and everything, and, therefore, it is only meant for administrative tasks. If a large number of users used root, normal daily tasks could bear a security risk that could be exploited. In other words, unless you know exactly what you are doing, you can expose your OS to viruses and other security breaches by using root.
